### Technologies Used

Node.js - A powerful server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express.js - A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose - A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
bcryptjs - A library for hashing passwords securely.
jsonwebtoken - A library for generating and validating JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
uuid - A package for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

        expirationDate
    }
}
```

3. Mutation: User Signup
   Create a new user account using GraphQL mutation.
