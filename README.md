# URL Shortener Project

## Introduction

Welcome to my URL Shortener project! This project allows users to shorten long URLs into easy-to-share and manage short URLs. It's built using modern technologies and follows industry best practices to ensure security, reliability, and performance.

### Technologies Used

Node.js - A powerful server-side JavaScript runtime.
Express.js - A fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js.
Mongoose - A MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.
bcryptjs - A library for hashing passwords securely.
jsonwebtoken - A library for generating and validating JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
uuid - A package for generating universally unique identifiers (UUIDs).

## GraphQL Queries

In addition to the REST API endpoints, the URL Shortener project also provides a GraphQL API for more flexible data retrieval. This API allows you to query user details and URL information. Below are the supported GraphQL queries:

1. Query: Get User Details

   Retrieve the details of a user based on their email.

   ````{
   getUser(email: $email) {
       email
       name
       urls {
       longUrl
       shortUrl
       expirationDate
       }
       verificationStatus
   }
   }```

   Variables
   email: The email of the user you want to retrieve information for.

   ````

2. Query: Get URL Details
   Retrieve the details of a URL based on its URL code.

```{
getUrl(urlCode: $urlCode) {
longUrl
shortUrl
expirationDate
}
}
```

Variables
urlCode: The unique code of the URL you want to retrieve information for.

## GraphQL Mutations

The GraphQL API also provides mutations to perform create and delete operations. Below are the supported GraphQL mutations:

1.  Mutation: Create User
    Create a new user.

    ````mutation{
    create(email: $email, name: $name, password: $password) {
    success
    }
    }```
    Variables
    email: The email of the new user.
    name: The name of the new user.
    password: The password of the new user.
    ````

2.  Mutation: Create User URL
    Create a new URL for a specific user.

    ````mutation {
    createUserUrl(longUrl: $longUrl, email: $email) {
    success
    }
    }```
    Variables
    longUrl: The original (long) URL to be shortened.
    email: The email of the user who wants to create the URL.

    ````

3.  Mutation: Delete User
    Delete a user based on their email.

    ````mutation {
    deleteUser(email: $email) {
    success
    }
    }```
    Variables
    email: The email of the user you want to delete.

    ````

4.  Mutation: Delete URL
    Delete a URL based on its ID.

````mutation {
deleteUrl(urlId: $urlId) {
success
}
}```
Variables
urlId: The unique ID of the URL you want to delete.
